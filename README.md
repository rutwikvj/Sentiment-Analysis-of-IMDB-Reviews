Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews using CNN, LSTM and GRU (Base and Improved Models)

The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews and its sentiment labels (positive or negative). The reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). Words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for instance the integer "3" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. The models perform a binary classification task that classifies the reviews under positive or negative reviews.
